### About Me 👨‍💻

My name is Mohamad, I'm a web developer on a life-long quest for knowledge. Prior to embarking on my software journey, I worked as a general contracting apprentice for a home remodeling company. During my apprenticeship, I discovered a newfound passion for learning new skills and problem solving. This adventure eventually led me to an accelerated full stack web development program. I've been fascinated by technology my entire life, and I'm motivated to combine my love of problem solving and interest in software to create applications that will improve the lives of others.

Hi, I'm Mohamad Alsyouf, a full stack web developer on a life-long quest for knowledge.

Prior to embarking on my software journey, I worked as a general contracting apprentice for a
home remodeling company. During my apprenticeship, I discovered a newfound passion for learning
new skills and problem solving. This adventure eventually led me to an accelerated full stack web
development program. I've been fascinated by technology my entire life, and I'm motivated to
combine my love of problem solving and interest in software to create applications that will
improve the lives of others.

I was able to devote over 800 hours total and 70 hours per week through a full-immersion
web development program at LearningFuze. I built on my foundation of not only programming
knowledge, but also the necessary skill sets that would propel me further along in my coding
adventure. The journey has only just begun.
