### About Me 👨‍💻

I'm Mohamad, an aspiring web developer on the pursuit of knowledge. Prior to beginning my journey into software, I worked as a general contracting apprentice for a home remodeling company. During my time as an apprentice, I discovered a newfound passion for learning new skills and solving problems. This journey then lead me into an accelerated full stack web development program. Having been intrigued by technology my entire life, I'm motivated to combine my love for problem solving and interest in software into creating applications that will positively impact the lives of others.
